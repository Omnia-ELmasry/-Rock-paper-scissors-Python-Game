# Rock-paper-scissors-Python-Game
“Rock paper scissors” is a simple and interesting game.<br /> 
Many of us used to play it in a school to resolve disputes or just to spend some time. <br /> 
But how to play if your friends are far away?  <br /> 
For this reason I develop this Game with simple Python 3 Code with only basics to be easy to understand ........ <br /> 
Hope you will enjoy playing it with friends or with computer as you can choose your mood single or 2 players from <br /> 
the menu in the beginning and you can know your score at the end.<br /> 

# What are the rules? <br /> 
The rules are very simple and probably you remember them from your childhood: <br /> 

-If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.<br /> 
-If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.<br /> 
-If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but lose against Scissors.<br /> <br /> 
There can be 3 to 5 rounds. The game ends when somebody gets 3 wins. <br /> 
If you want to play again, just choose “Play again”  after a game is finished.

# Requirements to Run :
* Jupyter Notebook  or use Online Python IDE https://repl.it/languages/python3 .
