# Rock-paper-scissors-Python-Game
“Rock paper scissors” is a simple and interesting game.
Many of us used to play it in a school to resolve disputes or just to spend some time.
But how to play if your friends are far away? 
For this reason I develop this Game with simple Python 3 Code with only basics to be easy to understand ........
Hope you will enjoy playing it with friends or with computer as you can choose your mood single or 2 players from 
the menu in the beginning and you can know your score at the end.

# What are the rules?
The rules are very simple and probably you remember them from your childhood:

If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.
If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.
If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but lose against Scissors.
There can be 3 to 5 rounds. The game ends when somebody gets 3 wins. If you want to play again, just choose “Play again”  after a game is finished.

# Requirements to Run :
* Jupyter Notebook  or use Online Python IDE https://repl.it/languages/python3 .
