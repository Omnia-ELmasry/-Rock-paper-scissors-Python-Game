# Rock-paper-scissors-Python-Game
“Rock paper scissors” is a simple and interesting game.
Many of us used to play it in a school to resolve disputes or just to spend some time.
But how to play if your friends are far away? 
For this reason I develop this Game with simple Python 3 Code with only basics to be easy to understand ........
Hope you will enjoy playing it with friends or with computer as you can choose your mood single or 2 players from 
the menu in the beginning and you can know your score at the end.
